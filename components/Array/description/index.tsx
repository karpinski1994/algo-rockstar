            An array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by a unique index or position in the array. Elements in an array can be of any data type, such as integers, characters, or objects. Arrays are efficient for index-based access to elements, as well as for performing operations like searching, sorting, and manipulating the elements. However, arrays have a fixed size, which means that once an array is created, its size cannot be changed dynamically. To overcome this limitation, some programming languages provide dynamic arrays, which automatically resize themselves as elements are added or removed.
