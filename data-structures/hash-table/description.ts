A hashtable, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that allows us to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently.

Hash tables use a hashing function to map keys to indices in an array.

The value associated with the key is then stored at that index in the array.

Hash tables are useful for when we need to look up values quickly based on their keys.

For example, in a web application, we can use a hash table to store user information, with the user ID as the key and the user object as the value.

#### Operations
A hashtable has three main operations:

Insert: Adding a new key-value pair to the hash table.

Lookup: Finding the value associated with a given key in the hash table.

Delete: Removing a key-value pair from the hash table.

#### Implementation
We can implement a hash table using an array and a hashing function.

The hashing function takes a key and returns an index in the array where the value associated with that key will be stored.

Here is an example of a hash table implemented using an array:
${"```javascript"}
// Creating an empty hash table const hashTable = []; 
// Hashing function function hashFunction(key)
// Some logic to generate an index based on the key return index;

// Adding elements to the hash table 
hashTable[hashFunction("one")] = "value1"; 
hashTable[hashFunction("two")] = "value2"; 
hashTable[hashFunction("three")] = "value3"; 

// Retrieving elements from the hash table 
const value1 = hashTable[hashFunction("one")]; 
const value2 = hashTable[hashFunction("two")]; 
const value3 = hashTable[hashFunction("three")]; 

console.log(value1); // will display "value1" 
console.log(value2); // will display "value2" 
console.log(value3); // will display "value3"
${"```"}
